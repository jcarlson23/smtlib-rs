# smtlib-rs

A family of crates for generating and interacting with SMTLIB.

## Crates

- `smtlib`: A high-level API for interacting with SMT solvers.
- `smtlib-lowlevel`: The low-level types for communicating with SMT solvers. Includes a SMTLIB2 parser, and an interactive way to have the SMT solver execute commands, interpret results, and respond to the results.
