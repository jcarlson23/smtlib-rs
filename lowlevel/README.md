# smtlib-lowlevel

> A low-level API for interacting with SMT solvers

This is the low-level counter-part to [`smtlib`](https://github.com/oeb25/smtlib-rs). It includes the low-level types for communicating with SMT solvers. Additionally, includes a SMTLIB2 parser, and an interactive way to have the SMT solver execute commands, interpret results, and respond to the results.
